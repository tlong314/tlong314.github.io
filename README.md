# UI/UX Demo

This page host screenshots and links representing years of UI/UX, design concepts, and development (game, web, and mobile). The content was all designed and developed by me (Tim S. Long), except where collaborations are mentioned, or others are credited.

## Wargame Sample UI

This simple mockup of wargame UI components was a collaboration between Stuart Pool and myself. This was created as a basic mockup demonstration, with basic web tools (HTML/CSS) and GIMP/Photoshop.

## Tournament Viewer (Figma)

This screen represents the online homepage for a fictional fighting game tournament named "CMG Fighters Tournament 2023". A screenshot of a retro-style fighting game is placed in the center to represent the output of a video player that would stream tournament news, player interviews, and match replays. The rest of the screen (page components, fonts styles, icons, color gradients, and everything else) was created in Figma.

## CMG Pattern Designer (with custom engine)

This is a sample drawing application with multiple UI components with complex functionality, all integrated into a compact workspace. This utilizes a web-based game engine I wrote (CMGame).

The web app gives the end user options to automatically perform extra tasks such as painting above, below, or inside a curve, and adjusting opacity/transparency. With these options set, the colorful pattern below was created with a few quick swipes:

## Color Palettes

Modern design aesthetics involve carefully chosen colors and a palette suitable for the current project. Below are some sample color palettes I have created. The first palette was developed for my web-based game engine, CMGame, and is inspired by modern flat design palettes. The vibrant color screenshots that follow are all from the math game "Swipe Correct" I developed for collegemathgames.com.

## Raidsim (by Stuart Pool)

Stuart Pool and I have both worked with multiple game engines before, including Unity and Unreal, but also work in different engines and software environments. Below is a description and screenshot of a game Stuart has been developing, RaidSimulator.

RaidSimulator is a realtime hexagonal-grid based game, built in Godot, a game engine which has many parallels with Unity's design. In this game, players need to keep track of their location, resources, and debuffs of their team. The panels on the left are dynamically spawned and display any active buffs and/or debuffs any individual character receives.

## Decoder Glass

This mobile application was developed with Android Studio (using its view modes to design UI elements via WYSIWYG editiing, as well as direct coding in Java and XML). The application guides a user through developing an "encoded" message that can then be shared, printed, etc., and "decoded" with the app's built-in red camera overlay. General design elements follow Android's "Material Design" concepts.

## SMLLC Checklist

This Android application uses both Android Studio's native design elements as well as web-based libraries, including Bootstrap and Angular. This application contains multiple integrated pieces: a local database storing existing checklists, an opened checklist UI, information modals for each checklist item (some of which include links to external information, and some of which connect to the web in order to perform actions such as determining if an LLC name exists within a state), trophies and badges to encourage user progression, and export features to work offline.

UI/UX Demo

This page host screenshots and links representing years of UI/UX, design concepts, and development (game, web, and mobile). The content was all designed and developed by me (Tim S. Long), except where colloborations are mentioned.

Wargame Sample UI

This simple mockup of wargame UI components was a collaboration between Stuart Pool and myself.

CMG Pattern Designer

This is a sample drawing application with multiple UI components with complex functionality, all integrated into a compact workspace.

Decoder Glass

This mobile application was developed with Android Studio (using its direct UI elements for WYSIWYG editiing, as well as direct coding in Java and XML). The application guides a user through developing an "encoded" message that can then be shared, printed, etc., and "decoded" with the app's built-in red camera overlay. General design elements follow Android's "Material Design" concepts.

Color Palettes

Modern design aesthetics involve carefully chosen colors and a palette suitable for the current project. Below are some sample color palettes I have created. The first palette was developed for my JavaScript-based game engine, cmgame.js, and is inspired by modern flat design palettes. The vibrant color screenshots that follow are all from the math game "Swipe Correct" I developed for collegemathgames.com.

(CMGame engine, cmgame.js)

SMLLC Checklist

This Android application uses both Android Studio's native design elements as well as web-based libraries, including Bootstrap and Angular. This application contains multiple integrated pieces: a local database storing existing checklists, an opened checklist UI, information modals for each checklist item (some of which include links to external information, and some of which connect to the web in order to perform actions such as determining if an LLC name exists within a state), trophies and badges to encourage user progression, and export features to work offline.
